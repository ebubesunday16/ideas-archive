# Getting Started with React Hooks

React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to use state and other React features without writing a class. They've revolutionized how we build React components, making code more reusable and easier to understand.

## Why Hooks?

Before Hooks, if you needed state in a component, you had to use a class component. This led to several issues:

- Complex components became hard to understand
- Reusing stateful logic between components was difficult
- Classes can be confusing with `this` binding

Hooks solve these problems by allowing you to:

- Use state and lifecycle features in functional components
- Extract and reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy
- Use React features without classes

## The Basic Hooks

### useState

The `useState` Hook lets you add state to functional components:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useEffect

The `useEffect` Hook performs side effects in functional components:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Creating Custom Hooks

One of the most powerful features of Hooks is the ability to create your own:

```jsx
function useWindowWidth() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    };
  }, []);
  
  return width;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Only call Hooks at the top level of your component
2. Only call Hooks from React function components or custom Hooks
3. Use the React Hooks linting rules
4. Keep your custom Hooks focused on a single responsibility

With these guidelines in mind, React Hooks can significantly simplify your components and make your code more maintainable.
