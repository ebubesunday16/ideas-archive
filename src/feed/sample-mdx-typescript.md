# Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. It adds static types to JavaScript, helping you catch errors early and making your code more robust.

## Why TypeScript?

JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means variables can change types throughout the lifetime of your program. While this provides flexibility, it can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to debug. TypeScript solves this by adding:

- Static typing
- Object-oriented features
- Compile-time error checking
- Rich IDE support

## Getting Started

First, install TypeScript:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

Create a simple TypeScript file (hello.ts):

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("TypeScript"));
```

Compile it to JavaScript:

```bash
tsc hello.ts
```

This will generate a `hello.js` file that you can run with Node.js.

## Key Features

### Type Annotations

```typescript
let name: string = "John";
let age: number = 30;
let isActive: boolean = true;
let hobbies: string[] = ["reading", "coding", "gaming"];
```

### Interfaces

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  active?: boolean; // Optional property
}

function createUser(user: User): User {
  return user;
}
```

### Classes

```typescript
class Person {
  private name: string;
  
  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  greet(): string {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`;
  }
}

const person = new Person("Jane");
console.log(person.greet());
```

## Integration with Modern Frameworks

TypeScript works seamlessly with popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue. For example, in React:

```tsx
interface Props {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
}

const Card: React.FC<Props> = ({ title, description = "No description" }) => {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Conclusion

TypeScript enhances JavaScript development by providing type safety without sacrificing the flexibility that makes JavaScript great. As your projects grow in size and complexity, the benefits of TypeScript become increasingly valuable in maintaining code quality and developer productivity.
